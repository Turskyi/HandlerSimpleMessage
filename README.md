# Project: Simple Connection State App

## What it does:

This simple Android app simulates the process of connecting to a remote device or service. The app
has a single screen with a button labeled "Connect". When the user taps the button, the app displays
a progress bar and changes the button text to "Connecting". After a simulated delay of 2 seconds,
the app changes the button text to "Connected" and hides the progress bar. After another 3 seconds,
the app reverts to its initial state with the button labeled "Connect" and the progress bar hidden.

## Why it is useful:

This app demonstrates how to use a Handler to update the UI from a background thread and how to
manage the state of the app using constants.

## Additional benefits:

* The app is simple and easy to use, making it a good choice for beginners who are learning Android
  development.
* The app is organized in a single activity, which makes it easy to understand and maintain.
* The app can be easily extended to simulate different connection scenarios, such as successful
  connections, failed connections, and timeouts.

Overall, this simple connection state app is a useful tool for learning about UI updates, state
management, and thread management in Android development.

Note: It is also worth noting that the provided code and layout could be easily adapted to create a
simple lemonade app. For example, the button could be labeled "Squeeze Lemon" and the progress bar
could be used to simulate the squeezing process. The Handler could then be used to update the UI
based on the progress of the simulation.
